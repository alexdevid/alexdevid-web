            <h5>Hello! My name is Alexander. I’m a full-stack web-developer from Russia.</h5>
            <p>
                I am highly motivated specialist in PHP and Javascript programming. I prefer to use modern trends
                and technologies for building high-quality web-apps. My preference is back-end in PHP but front-end does not
                frighten me. Moreover I am interested in building large-scale client-based applications. About 7 years of
                experience in building different web applications as for backend and for frontend. I mostly work in
                enterprise sphere but had some freelance experience and personal side-projects.

        <div class="content">
            <h5>Backend</h5>
            <p>
                For the server-side I prefer to use LAMP stack or Nginx and php-fpm. I'm using MySQL/PostgreSQL and Redis for data
                storage.
                I don't like to write complicated SQL queries because i mostly work with ORM like or example Propel or Doctrine or Active Record.
                I have experience with such frameworks as Yii, Yii2, Symfony2-Symfony5, Slim, Silex and others.
                I am able to start using the new one very quickly.
            </p>
            <h5>Frontend</h5>
            <p>
                I am very experienced with HTML and CSS. I am using SASS/Compass or LESS as CSS-preprocessors. I am able to create complex client-based apps using
                either VanillaJs or using frameworks (Angular, Backbone, Vue).
            </p>
            <h5>
                I have experience with following technologies:
